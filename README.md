## PowerPoint

The PowerPoint is included in this directory.

Or you can find it here: [office.com](https://studenthowest-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/harman_singh_student_howest_be/EYgiDs1PyNRAt6ueJ4GsfWQB4TbJdu-DOA3mIW3X4fYS4Q?e=uK4udn), but I think this requires a Howest-account.

## Comparison of pre-trained models (and fine-tune [FT])

Here you will find the comparisons of all the different pre-trained models we tested, and if the fine-tuned we trained.

The models were trained locally using an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (6GB VRAM), and 32GB of RAM. The one marked with (\*) was ran on Google Collab using the T4 GPU
